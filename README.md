# BreastCancerAwarenessMonth
A page I'm building to help spread awareness and info about breast cancer and to fundraise for the month of October because it's breast cancer awareness month.

I've already incorporated an about me section, a carousel of pictures of my experience to share, music and a few facts.

I still need to add more facts, resources, my story, and some other thing that are still in the works

I am struggling trying to render each of the resources. I'm trying to use a constructor function to do so but it is only rendering the first resource, and is telling
me that I can't set innerHTML to null


this page IS NOT finished, it still needs cleaning up and refactoring and all kinds of things 

Built with:
HTML
CSS
JacaScript

I'm very happy with the design and the animations in this project. This project allowed me to branch out and figure out how to do things I had not learned yet.
